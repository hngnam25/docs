title: "Overview"
---

## 1. Prerequisites

1. **Docker** installed and running on your system.

   * Refer to [Docker Docs]() to install Docker on your platform.

2. **Python 3.7+** and `pip` installed.

   * You will need Python to run the SDK code.

3. (Optional) **Docker Compose**, if you prefer to manage multiple containers with a single file.

## 2. Understanding the Gateway Architecture

Gateway consists of two main components:

1. **API Server**

   * A Flask+Gunicorn web server that receives REST requests on a specific port (e.g., `:5000`).

   * Forwards requests to the Inference Server.

2. **Inference Server**

   * Handles the heavy lifting: retrieval + re-ranking of evidence and final contradiction checks.

   * Communicates with the API server via an internal endpoint or shared network.

### Typical Flow

1. **Client / Python SDK** sends a request to the **API Server**.

2. **API Server** validates the input, passes it to the **Inference Server**.

3. **Inference Server**:

   * Retrieves relevant evidence.

   * Reranks evidence based on relevance.

   * Determines if the evidence supports or contradicts the claim.

4. **API Server** returns a structured response to the **Client**.

## 3. Setting Up:

You have two options for connecting the **Python SDK** to a running instance of Gateway:

### **Option 1: Use the Trial API Hosted by Truth Systems**

For convenience, we provide a **trial API** that you can use without setting up Docker. Simply use the provided URL:

```python
client = Client.from_url("https://api.truthsystems.com")
```

If you have been given **trial credentials**, include them in your request headers when making API calls.

### **Option 2: Host Your Own Gateway via Docker**

<Tip>
  To setup the Docker Image, head to our guide on [Setting Up Your Gateway Docker Image](https://truthsystems.mintlify.app/DockerImage)
</Tip>

After completing the setup, you can connect to your locally running API server:

```python
client = Client.from_url("http://localhost:5000")
```

**If you have modified the default port or are running on a remote server, adjust the URL accordingly.**

## 4. Python SDK:

On top of this backend, a **Python SDK** offers a high-level interface to interact with Gateway programmatically.

### Key Classes

* **`Client`**
  Creates an object that communicates with the Gateway’s API Server. It exposes methods like `judge()` to submit claims and evidence.

* **`Verdict`**
  An enumeration of possible judgments about a claim (e.g., `SUPPORTS`, `CONTRADICTS`, or `NEUTRAL`).

* **`TextSource`**
  Represents a piece of textual evidence.

* **`TextInfluence`**
  Provides additional context on how a piece of text influenced the verdict (e.g., specific substring indices).

### Example Usage

```python
from truthsys import (
    Client,          # or AsyncClient
    TextInfluence,
    TextSource,
    Verdict,
)

# 1. Instantiate the client
client = Client.from_url("http://localhost:5000")

# 2. Create text sources (evidence)
sources = [
    TextSource.from_text("I have a cat"),
    TextSource.from_text("I only have one pet"),
    TextSource.from_text("My pet is called Sally"),
]

# 3. Judge the claim
ruling = client.judge(
    claim="Sally is a pretty cat",
    sources=sources,
)

# 4. Inspect the overall verdict
if ruling.verdict is Verdict.SUPPORTS:
    print("Sally really is a pretty cat!")
elif ruling.verdict is Verdict.CONTRADICTS:
    print("Evidence contradicts this claim!")
else:
    print("Evidence is inconclusive.")

# 5. Examine individual statements and influences
for statement in ruling.statements:
    print(f'Statement: "{statement.text}" -> {statement.verdict}')
    for influence in statement.influences:
        print(f"  Influence from: {influence.source}")
        print(f"  Content: {influence.text}")
        if isinstance(influence, TextInfluence):
            print(f"  Span indices: {influence.span[0]} - {influence.span[1]}")
```

* **`Client.from_url(...)`** targets the Gateway’s API Server endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).

* **`TextSource.from_text(...)`** constructs each piece of textual evidence. You can have multiple sources in a single call.

* **`ruling = client.judge(...)`** returns a rich response containing:- **`ruling.verdict`**: the overall truthfulness verdict.

  * **`ruling.statements`**: sub-statements derived from the original claim, each with its own verdict.

  * **`statements[i].influences`**: the pieces of textual evidence that influenced the statement’s verdict.

## High-Level Workflow

1. **Start** the API and Inference servers (see [Setting Up Your Docker Image](https://truthsystems.mintlify.app/DockerImage)).

2. **Install** the `truthsys` Python package with `pip install truthsys` (or whichever means provided).

3. **Write** your Python script or library code to:

   * Import the SDK components (`Client`, `TextSource`, etc.).

   * Create a client pointing to your Gateway’s base URL.

   * Invoke `judge()` with a claim and supporting evidence.

   * Process and interpret the returned `ruling`.

With this approach, you can quickly integrate **Gateway** into a variety of applications—AI services, data processing pipelines, or end-user applications that require evidence-based claim checking.
